<p>Brewed an XPA today with pils/munich base hopped with mosaic, amarillo, and
centennial.</p>

<p>Got started around 10:00 AM, but was in no particular rush. Cleaned
up around 4:30 PM. Mash went well, despite having just enough foil for the
screen. Hit target gravity, but a little short on wort (poured the sludge in to
hit 5 gallons). Was able to get down to 70&deg; with the sump pump and a
single bag of ice.</p>

<p>Was going to do an even split of mosaic and amarillo, but found a bag of
centennial that was asking to be used.</p>

<p>Recipe is as follows ...</p>

<h4>Grain:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>10 lbs. German Pilsner Malt</li>

  <li>1 lb. White Wheat Malt</li>
  <li>1/4 lb. Acid Malt</li>
  <li>1/4 lb. Melanoiden Malt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mash:</h4>
<p>Mashed in at 148&deg; for what turned out to be ~75 minutes.</p>
